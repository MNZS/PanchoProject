# PanchoProject
Pancho is a retired Open Source project from the early 2000s.

Perl based tool which allows network administrators to archive device configurations as well as make changes to these remote nodes through the use of SNMP and TFTP.  Pancho is module based in the sense that support for new vendors may be created using a template provided with the distribution and then shared to the community of users.
